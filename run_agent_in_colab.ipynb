    "1. Upload relevant python files to Google Colab instance (can drag and drop them).\n",

    "3. Disable all calls of `env.render()` or `envs.render()` in your code as Colab can't display the game board. If you forget this, you'll see this error: `No X11 DISPLAY variable was set, but this program performed an operation which requires it.`\n",
